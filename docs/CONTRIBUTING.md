# Contributing to Our Creativity Website

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Our Creativity website project! While direct code contributions might be managed by a core team, your feedback, bug reports, and suggestions are highly valuable.

## Reporting Bugs

If you encounter a bug or an issue on the website, please help us by reporting it. When reporting a bug, try to include the following information:

1.  **A clear and descriptive title.**
2.  **Steps to reproduce the bug:** Be as specific as possible.
3.  **What you expected to happen.**
4.  **What actually happened:** Include screenshots if helpful.
5.  **Your browser and operating system:** (e.g., Chrome on Windows 11, Safari on macOS Sonoma).
6.  **Any error messages** you saw.

Please send bug reports to [Specify Email Address or Link to Issue Tracker if one exists - e.g., ourcreativity.support@example.com or GitHub Issues page if public].

## Suggesting Enhancements or Features

We are always open to ideas for improving the website and our community platform. If you have a suggestion for a new feature or an enhancement to an existing one:

1.  **Provide a clear and descriptive title.**
2.  **Explain the feature/enhancement:** What would it do? Why is it useful?
3.  **Outline any potential benefits** to the users or the community.

Please send your suggestions to [Specify Email Address or Link for Feature Requests - e.g., ourcreativity.ideas@example.com].

## Code Contributions (If Applicable)

If the project becomes open to direct code contributions in the future, this section will be updated with guidelines on:

*   Forking the repository.
*   Creating feature branches.
*   Coding style (we use ESLint - configuration is in `.eslintrc.cjs`).
*   Submitting Pull Requests.
*   Commit message conventions.

For now, development is handled by the core team.

## Community Guidelines

Please ensure all your interactions, whether reporting bugs, suggesting features, or participating in community channels, adhere to a respectful and constructive tone. Our goal is to maintain a positive and inclusive environment for all creators.
