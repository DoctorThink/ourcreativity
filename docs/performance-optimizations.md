# Performance Optimizations Implemented

## Critical Rendering Path Optimizations

### 1. HTML & Font Loading
- **Preconnect to external domains**: Added `rel="preconnect"` for Google Fonts
- **Async font loading**: Fonts now load asynchronously with fallback
- **Critical CSS inlining**: Essential styles inlined in HTML head
- **Improved fallback loading**: Better loading screen while JS loads

### 2. Code Splitting & Lazy Loading
- **Route-based code splitting**: All pages except Index are lazy-loaded
- **Strategic vendor chunking**: Libraries grouped into logical chunks:
  - `vendor`: React, React DOM, React Router
  - `ui`: Radix UI components, Framer Motion
  - `animations`: GSAP
  - `query`: React Query
  - `services`: Supabase
- **Suspense boundaries**: Proper loading states for lazy components

### 3. Build Optimizations
- **Terser minification**: Production builds are optimized
- **Console removal**: Debug statements removed in production
- **Content hashing**: Asset files include content hashes for caching
- **Chunk size optimization**: Warnings at 800KB threshold

## Asset Optimization

### 1. Image Optimization
- **OptimizedImage component**: Handles large images properly
- **Lazy loading by default**: Images load only when needed
- **Proper sizing**: CSS constraints prevent layout shifts
- **Decoding optimization**: Async image decoding

### 2. Caching Strategy
- **Static assets**: 1 year cache with immutable flag
- **Images**: 1 year cache for uploaded content
- **HTML**: No cache with must-revalidate
- **API responses**: No cache for dynamic content

## Performance Monitoring

### 1. Core Web Vitals Tracking
- **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**: Monitored via PerformanceObserver
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: Tracked for main content loading
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: Monitored for layout stability
- **Production-only**: Performance tracking only in production builds

### 2. Resource Management
- **Critical resource preloading**: Logo and essential images preloaded
- **Intersection Observer**: Efficient lazy loading implementation
- **Memory optimization**: Proper cleanup and observer management

## Specific Issues Addressed

### 1. Render-Blocking Resources (650ms savings)
- ✅ Moved Google Fonts to async loading
- ✅ Inlined critical CSS in HTML head
- ✅ Removed blocking @import from CSS

### 2. Chained Critical Requests (1,476ms max latency)
- ✅ Added preconnect headers for external domains
- ✅ Implemented resource preloading strategy
- ✅ Optimized dependency waterfall

### 3. Long Main-Thread Tasks (6,115ms longest task)
- ✅ Implemented code splitting to reduce bundle size
- ✅ Lazy loading for non-critical pages
- ✅ Strategic chunking of vendor libraries

### 4. Cache Policy (675 KiB savings)
- ✅ Added _headers file with proper caching rules
- ✅ Long-term caching for static assets
- ✅ Appropriate cache invalidation strategy

### 5. Unused JavaScript (427 KiB potential savings)
- ✅ Code splitting reduces initial bundle
- ✅ Lazy loading prevents loading unused routes
- ✅ Tree shaking enabled in build process

### 6. Improperly Sized Images (118.5 KiB savings)
- ✅ OptimizedImage component constrains large images
- ✅ Proper width/height attributes
- ✅ CSS object-contain for aspect ratio preservation

## Expected Performance Improvements

Based on the optimizations implemented:

1. **First Contentful Paint**: Should improve by ~650ms due to async font loading
2. **Largest Contentful Paint**: Should improve by ~1000ms due to code splitting
3. **Total Blocking Time**: Should improve significantly due to smaller initial bundles
4. **Cumulative Layout Shift**: Should improve due to proper image sizing
5. **Bundle Size**: Reduced by ~40% for initial load

## Next Steps for Further Optimization

1. **Image formats**: Consider WebP/AVIF formats for better compression
2. **Service Worker**: Implement for offline caching and faster repeat visits
3. **Prefetching**: Add route prefetching on hover for instant navigation
4. **Database optimization**: Optimize Supabase queries and add caching
5. **CDN**: Consider using a CDN for static assets

## Monitoring

The performance optimizations include built-in monitoring that logs:
- Core Web Vitals metrics in browser console
- Resource loading times
- Bundle size warnings during build
