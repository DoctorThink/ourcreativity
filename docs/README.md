# Project Documentation

This directory contains documentation related to the OurCreativity project.

## Purpose

The `docs` directory serves as a central place for project-related documents that help developers and contributors understand different aspects of the project, its components, and its evolution.

## Contents

- **`updates.md`**: This file contains a log of significant updates, announcements, and changes made to the project. It's a good place to look for information about new features, recruitment drives, events, or major version changes.

- **`components.md`**: This file provides detailed documentation for the React components used in the frontend of this project, primarily located under `src/components/`. Each component entry includes its file path, a brief description of its purpose, and a list of its props (properties) with their expected types, optionality, and default values if any. This is an essential resource for developers working with the UI components.

- **`README.md`**: This file (you are reading it now!) explains the purpose of the `docs` directory and provides an overview of its contents.

## Maintaining Documentation

As the project evolves, it's important to keep the documentation in this directory up-to-date. When new components are added or existing ones are modified, `components.md` should be updated accordingly. Similarly, major project updates or announcements should be added to `updates.md`.
