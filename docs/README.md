# Project Documentation

This directory contains documentation related to the OurCreativity project. It serves as a central knowledge base for developers and contributors.

## Contents

-   **`01-Glowar-Design-System.md`**: The complete specification for our **Glowar** design language, including its core philosophy, pillars, and component guidelines. This is the source of truth for all UI/UX decisions.

-   **`02-Project-Architecture.md`**: A high-level overview of the project's technical stack (React, Vite, Supabase) and the repository's folder structure.

-   **`03-Setup-and-Installation.md`**: A step-by-step guide for new developers to get the project running on their local machine.

-   **`04-Supabase-Schema.md`**: Detailed documentation of our Supabase database schema, including tables, columns, and their purposes.

-   **`components.md`**: Auto-generated or manually maintained documentation for the reusable React components found in `src/components/`. *(This file is a carryover and may be partially superseded by the Glowar Design System document).*

## Maintaining Documentation

As the project evolves, it's crucial to keep the documentation in this directory up-to-date.
- When the design language is updated, modify `01-Glowar-Design-System.md`.
- When significant architectural changes are made, update `02-Project-Architecture.md`.
- When the database schema is altered, reflect those changes in `04-Supabase-Schema.md`.
